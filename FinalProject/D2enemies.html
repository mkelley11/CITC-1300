                <h3>The Fallen</h3>
        
            <p>
                The fallen are one of the main types of enemies within Destiny 2.  They are a nomadic race of alien scavengers who were once part of a powerful interstellar civilization known as the Eliksni. However, their civilization fell into ruin after a massive event called the Whirlwind, which left them scattered and pretty much destroyed. They can be characterized by their almost insect like features with multiple arms and glowing eyes, and they are divided into various houses, each with its own leadership and societal structure. Some of the major Fallen houses include the House of Devils, House of Wolves, House of Dusk, and House of Kings.
