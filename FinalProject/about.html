        <h2> Raiding</h2>

    <p>
        There is a ton of things todo within destiny. Way too much to even begin listing them. However one activity rises above the rest in terms of players needed, difficulty and coordination. Raids are a staple within and a big achievements for some players in Destiny 2. Raids are a 6 man activity with no matchmaking meaning you have to have 6 players you know to join in and help you. Stated from the destiny wiki themselves "Raids typically involve epic, climactic encounters against various bosses, culminating in intense final battles against legendary bosses across the Destiny series." Like I previously noted raids do not tell you how todo any of it. You basically either watch a video on how todo it or somebody that already knows what todo teaches you. On top of that raiding on average takes about an hour IF all 6 knows what they're doing.

                <h3>The day 1 race</h3>
        
            <p>
                The day 1 raid race is probably the biggest event in destiny each year. In recent years it has been twice a year because of bungie brinhing back old raids from the previous game. Each year when a raid releases, bungie will hold a massive competition to see who can be the first in the world to figure out and complete the raid. The winner of this massive competition recieves a real life WWE style championship belt to show off their accolade. This obviously means the absolute best of the best come out each year to see who has what it takes to be world's first, Noteably the raid from the foresaken expansion named "Last Wish" took players 17 concecutive hours to beat. That event went down in destiny history of what  players can do when they want something bad enough and good of an activity raids really are.
