                <p>
                    "The Bungie 30th Anniversary Event in Destiny 2 is additional content that fits somewhere between a season and a full expansion. It isn’t designed to tell a lengthy story or expand to a fully new location, but it does provide a large and exciting release of gear weapons and activities. All of this celebrates Bungie’s storied history as a developer and wraps in armaments, easter eggs, and straight-up recreations of iconic gear from the likes of Halo, Vanilla Destiny, and lesser-known games like Marathon." -
