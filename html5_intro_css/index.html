        <p> This has been an ongoing question many people have asked while working in the cyber security field.

            <h3>Not enough worry</h3>
            <p>In today’s world, many of us use some sort of technology daily. Whether that be browsing the web, checking social media, looking at the news, or even checking the weather, we are all utilizing tech. For some, their computer or phone is their livelihood. This is especially true for the people who work from home or use their devices for work every day. Many daily users don’t put enough thought into using the correct online protection like antivirus software or a VPN (Virtual Private Network) when it comes to their online activities. Bypassing good virus and malware protection could result in users leaving their devices vulnerable to these online attacks.</p>

        <h3>Virus Plague</h3>
        <p> Viruses, malware, and ransomware have been plaguing technology since the first computer in 1996. However, the first sample of ransomware dates to 1989. These attacks are not shy of being malicious. Some people might be very familiar with these type of attacks as it encrypts the device’s files and prompts a payment menu on the victim’s screen requiring a type of payment to access different things on the device. One of the most notable attacks was when a Russian hacker released an extremely harmful type of ransomware that would delete the users’ documents and files if payment was not provided. Since most of these attacks require payment in bitcoin, it allows it to be nearly untraceable by law enforcement. These types of attacks have majorly increased in time and is a very fast-growing business.</p>
