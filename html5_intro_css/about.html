        <h2> cyberattacks</h2>
        <p>Cyberattacks could also be a huge safety concern for everyday users. Furthermore, with the internet growing more than ever in recent years “doxing” has been on the rise amongst online users. The term “doxing” is a modern-day term originating from 90s hacking culture that shortened “word documents”. It is a form of cyber-attack involving leaking someone’s personal information or any unknown information online that could be potentially dangerous to the person’s safety if it got released. For example, someone’s home address, credit card numbers, online passwords, and even license plates could be leaked to the public. These instances have seen nothing but an increase as the world advances to have more things digitally. </p>
