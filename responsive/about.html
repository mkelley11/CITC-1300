        <h2> cyberattacks</h2>
        <p>Cyberattacks could also be a huge safety concern for everyday users. Furthermore, with the internet growing more than ever in recent years “doxing” has been on the rise amongst online users. The term “doxing” is a modern-day term originating from 90s hacking culture that shortened “word documents”. It is a form of cyber-attack involving leaking someone’s personal information or any unknown information online that could be potentially dangerous to the person’s safety if it got released. For example, someone’s home address, credit card numbers, online passwords, and even license plates could be leaked to the public. These instances have seen nothing but an increase as the world advances to have more things digitally. </p>

    <h3>Saftey Concerns</h3>
    <p>
        Another type of attack is hacking.  People do not take “human hacking” as seriously as they should. “Human hacking” as some would call it, is a form of exploit that cyber criminals can perform on people themselves. “Whether by accident or intent employees are often the root cause of successful cyberattacks,” Bissell et al. The Cost of Cyber Crime. For example, contacting businesses or services claiming to be someone they’re not or a close friend or relative of the said victim to gain access to useful private information.
