        <h2> Affecting Businesses</h2>

    <p>
        In the future, businesses will be at the forefront of this cyberattack epidemic. A recent study shows that nearly 70% of all businesses are not prepared for a cyberattack. Data breaches are one of the most common cyberattacks when it comes to big business. Information theft is one of the fastest-growing industries in cyberspace because of its fast nature and how easily cyber criminals can get in. For instance, hospital patient files are a sought-after commodity by these criminals. If they can access the files, they can be resold for top dollar. Health records are a low risk, high reward target.  “5.2 trillion dollars’ worth of data globally are at risk of indirect or direct cyberattacks. As the number of cyberattacks increases and takes more time to resolve, the cost of cybercrime continues to rise,” Bissell et al. The Cost of Cyber Crime.
