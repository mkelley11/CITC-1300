    <h2>Not enough worry</h2>
    <p>In today’s world, many of us use some sort of technology daily. Whether that be browsing the web, checking social media, looking at the news, or even checking the weather, we are all utilizing tech.  For some, their computer or phone is their livelihood. This is especially true for the people who work from home or use their devices for work every day. \ Many daily users don’t put enough thought into using the correct online protection like antivirus software or a VPN (Virtual Private Network) when it comes to their online activities. Bypassing good virus and malware protection could result in users leaving their devices vulnerable to these online attacks.</p>
